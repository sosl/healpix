test data for Healpix 2.1

used by 'make test'

*.par: input parameter file of each code

*.fits: input data and reference for comparison of output

   --  cl.fits: input power spectrum of current release.
       currently identical to wmap_lcdm_pl_model_yr1_v1.fits (see Note below)
   --  cl_old.fits: input power spectrum of previous Healpix releases

*.gif: GIF image of the reference maps



test*.fits: output data of runs

test*.gif: output figures of runs



see Installation Document for details


Notes: 
     1) The file wmap_lcdm_pl_model_yr1_v1.fits currently matches cl.fits
  which was used for test simulations present in this directory.

  It is WMAP 1yr best fit, Spergel et al, 2003; with B modes = 0
  assuming a power low spectrum. It is identical to
  http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/map/powspec/wmap_lcdm_pl_model_yr1_v1.fits
  except for cosmetic editions of the FITS header

     2) The file wmap_lcdm_sz_lens_wmap5_cl_v3.fits 
 has been added in this directory for convenience, even though
 it is currently *NOT* used in any of the simulations included here.

 It is adapted from WMAP 5yr best fit model for l-CDM + SZ + lensing with B mode = 0
 input file = wmap_lcdm_sz_lens_wmap5_cl_v3.dat;
