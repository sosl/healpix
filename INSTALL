Healpix 2.11 Installation
=========================

Healpix 2.11 contains 5 independent packages (Fortran90, IDL, C, C++ and java) 
whose installation procedure is summarized below.

Every effort has been made to make the installation and usage of Healpix easy and straightforward.
However we highly recommend the user to read the documentation
(see   
   doc/html/main.htm  
or
   doc/html/install.htm  
or  
   doc/pdf/install.pdf 
or   
   http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/healpixSoftwareDocumentation.shtml)

All packages, expect the java one, can be configured, compiled and tested with the commands
./configure [-L]
 make
 make test

the 'configure' script lets you pick which package(s) you want to configure.
Type 'configure -h' for more information on that script online options.

Installing the F90 package
--------------------------
See 
   doc/html/install.htm  
or  
   doc/pdf/install.pdf 
for a detailled description of the installation procedure 
and the list of requirements.

If those requirements are met, simply running
   ./configure [-L]
   make f90-all
   make f90-test
should be enough to install and test the package.

More information on the F90 package can be found at
  doc/pdf/facilities.pdf
  doc/pdf/subroutines.pdf
or
  doc/html/facilities.htm
  doc/html/subroutines.htm


Configuring the IDL package
--------------------------

The 
   ./configure [-L]
script *must* be run to ensure that the Healpix IDL routines will be available
and to select the softwares used to visualize the images (Postscript and Png) 
created by those routines.
Then the
  hidl
  hidlde
commands will give you access to IDL augmented of Healpix routines.

For more information on the IDL package see
  doc/html/idl.htm
  doc/pdf/idl.pdf


Installing the C package
------------------------

The sequence
  ./configure [-L]
  make c-all
  make c-test
should do the job.

If it fails, see src/C/README
or
   doc/html/install.htm  
or  
   doc/pdf/install.pdf 

For more information on the C package see
  doc/html/csub.htm
  doc/pdf/csub.pdf


Installing the C++ package
--------------------------

To install the C++ package, a cfitsio tar ball (of the form cfitisio*.tar.gz) 
must be available, then do

   ./configure [-L]
   make cpp-all
   make cpp-test

See src/cxx/README.compilation
or
   doc/html/install.htm  
or  
   doc/pdf/install.pdf 

For more information on the C++ package see
  doc/html/index_cxx.htm (always available)
or
  src/cxx/doc/index.html (available when package installed)


Installing the java package
---------------------------

See src/java/README

For more information on the java package see
  doc/html/java/index.html
or 
  src/java/healpixjava/healpixdocs/index.html
