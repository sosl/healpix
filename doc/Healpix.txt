WHAT IS IT
==========
This directory contains the software synfast and anafast,
version 1.0.0 written and developed by Eric Hivon (hivon@tac.dk) and 
Krzysztof Gorski (gorski@tac.dk), 
which allows respectively :
to simulate full sky maps of CMB fluctuations from their power spectrum,
and to compute the power spectrum of a full sky fluctuation map, 
in both cases for HEALPIX pixelisation,
for Temperature and Polarisation.
These codes are released specifically for the PLANCK project.

CAUTION !
========
 This set of routines is aimed at implementing the HEALPIX
 pixelisation of the sphere (Gorski, 1997) for simulations and analysis
 of data related to the PLANCK project.
 This version is released prior to the implementation of any
 project-wide software standards and coding practices.
 The I/O interface of this package is thus likely to undergo significant revisions 
 in the future, which would result in releases of updated versions of this 
 software.
