\section{Introduction}

In this document the installation procedure for the \healpix
distribution is outlined. \healpix comprises a suite of Fortran 90, C++, 
IDL and Java routines
providing both stand-alone facilities and callable subroutines as an alternative
for those users who wish to build their own tools.
A set of C subroutines and functions is also provided. 

The distribution can be downloaded as a gzipped and tarred file,
which can be unpacked by executing the commands \hfill\newline
%\begin{verbatim}
{\tt \% gunzip Healpix\_\hpxversion.tar.gz}\hfill\\
{\tt \% tar -xpf Healpix\_\hpxversion.tar}\hfill\\
%\end{verbatim}

\end{figure}

The unpacked distribution has a directory structure as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:dirtree}.

As with most freely available software, the distribution
comes with caveats, the major one being that although we have attempted
to automate the installation as much as possible, not all eventualities
can ever be foreseen. We have tested the installation on the following 
platforms: \hfill\newline
\noindent AIX, IRIX, IRIX64, Linux, SunOS, ALPHA and Darwin (MacOS) \hfill\newline

There may be problems in the facility build due to the local system 
configuration which is beyond our control. 

\section{Installation Requirements}
\label{sec:requirements}
The major part of the \healpix distribution is written in both \textbf{Fortran 90} and \textbf{C++} and
so the appropriate compiler(s) must be present (Linux and Darwin users should look
at Section~\ref{sec:freef90compilers} about free F90 compilers. Microsoft Windows
users should look at Section~\ref{sec:windows}). Many visualisation tools and map
manipulation routines are provided in \textbf{IDL} (please note 
that at least version \idlversion is required) and \textbf{Java}. Some of the \healpix routines are
also available in \textbf{C}.

{\em This section and the next focus on the compilation and installation of the
  \textbf{C}, \textbf{C++}, \textbf{Fortran~90}  and \textbf{IDL} routines. For more information on the 
\textbf{Java} routines see table~\ref{tab:allpackages}}

The configure script is written in the Bourne shell. The script
attempts to generate a {\tt Makefile} which is tailored to one of 
the above Operating Systems (OS's) and using 
{\tt Makefile.in} as a template for non system-specific statements. 
Only the basic UNIX make facility is required to build the software, although we do
still recommend the GNU make facility (\htmladdnormallink{{\tt ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/}}{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/}).
In addition, several environment configuration files and an IDL startup file are
generated. These automatically establish
various environment variables and aliases to make the use of the
\healpix package simpler. 

The \healpix \textbf{Fortran 90}, \textbf{C++} and \textbf{C} distributions also require the publicly available CFTISIO
library:

%(versions 5.3 to 6.2 have been extensively used during the development
%of the \healpix IDL codes).
As it was already the case in version 1.20, users no longer need to acquire the IDL
Astronomy User's Library (\htmladdnormallink{{\tt http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/homepage.html}}{http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/homepage.html})
or the COBE (IDL) Analysis Software (\htmladdnormallink{{\tt http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/cobe/cgis.cfm}}{http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/cobe/cgis.cfm}),
although we do recommend these packages to the user.
The 100-odd routines required for version \hpxversion\ are contained in the
subdirectory {\tt Healpix\_\hpxversion/src/idl/zzz\_external}.
These procedures are included in the \healpix package unchanged and 
solely for the purpose of making it self contained. In this way,
we remove the burden of installation of additional libraries from 
the end user.

% For convenience we provide the freely available FFTPACK\footnote{At 
% {\tt
% http://math.nist.gov/cgi-bin/gams-serve/list-package-components/FFTPACK.html}}
% routines ''rffti'', ''rfftf'' and ''rfftb''.
%

%% At the user choice (at installation time) the FFT operations can be
%% performed with the FFT code shipped with the package, or with the
%% freely available FFTW. In the latter case FFTW should be compiled in
%% double precision.

A parallel implementation (based on OpenMP, for shared memory architectures) of the Spherical Harmonics
Transforms involved in {\tt synfast, anafast, smoothing, plmgen} and {\tt alteralm} is now
available by default and can be readily compiled and used with the standard installation script. 

A set of routines with MPI parallelization (for distributed memory architectures)
 is also available for Spherical Harmonics Transform, thanks to the work of H.K. Eriksen
 (h.k.k.eriksen@astro.uio.no) and Snorre Boasson (ITEA, NTNU). See the F90
 subroutines documentation for more information on how to use those routines in
 your code.
%% , thanks to the work of St\'ephane Colombi. It has
%% only been tested on SGI and DEC computers.
%% At this point, it can \textbf{not} be used together with FFTW.

We found that it was remarkably difficult to find 
random number generators in the public
domain which are simple yet
powerful and easy to use. 
We are providing one (both in C++ and F90) which is an adaptation of an xorshift generator described
 in Marsaglia (Journal of Statistical Software 2003, vol 8). It has a theoretical period of $2^{128}-1 \approx 3.4\ 10^{38}$.

%% One of us (BDW) has therefore attempted to create one and we
%% provide it as free software with this package (cf. Appendix I).

\section{The Installation Procedure}

If the user has one of the supported OS's, then installation proceeds utilizing
the following commands. If your OS is not supported, the configuration step
should be omitted, {\tt Makefile.in} should be copied as {\tt Makefile} and explicitly
tailored to the user environment.


\begin{flushright}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.3\hsize} p{0.60\hsize}}
{\tt \% ./configure} {\em [-L]}    & uses {\tt Makefile.in} as a template to build 
                         the correct Makefile (from user inputs as required), it
                         will also configure the IDL routines\\
{\tt \% make}           & builds all the facilities \\
{\tt \% make test}      & tests all the facility previously compiled \\
{\tt \% make clean}     & removes object files \\
%%%%%{\tt \% make vclean}    & 
{\tt \% make tidy}      & removes object files, executables and libraries \\
{\tt \% make distclean} & same as above and restores the directories to the state of the 
                          original distribution \\
%% {\tt \% ./config\_preview} & configure the IDL previewer
\end{tabular}
\end{flushright}
These different steps are detailled below.

\subsection{./configure [-L]}

The {\tt ./configure} script manages the configuration of the C, C++,
Fortran90 and IDL suites of routines and facilities.

Since v2.11, it accepts the {\tt -L} option to write the \healpix specific configuration files
into the \healpix directory itself rather than in installer's home directory (see
\S~\ref{subsub:conf}).
Using the {\tt -L} option is recommended when doing a {\em project} or {\em system wide} installation of
\healpix to be accessed by several different users.

An online help is available with {\tt ./configure -h}.

\subsubsection{Configuration profile}
\label{subsub:conf}
A feature introduced in previous releases and enhanced since v2.10, is that 
the configure script creates a shell configuration file \hfill\\
(located in
{\tt \$\{HOME\}/.healpix/2\_12\_}{\em $\langle$OS\_TYPE$\rangle$}{\tt /config}
or in
\hfill\\
{\tt \$\{HEALPIX\}/confdir/2\_12\_}{\em $\langle$OS\_TYPE$\rangle$}{\tt /config}
if {\tt ./configure -L} was used)
according to shell
type in which various environment variables and aliases are defined
for your convenience. If you agree upon prompting, it will also
change your default system profile during installation to
automatically source this profile. If you do not agree to this change,
you will need to explicitly source the configuration file above for any session in
which you intend to run \healpix facilities. {\bf In particular, you will
have to make sure that the {\tt HEALPIX} system variable is correctly
defined (as the full path to the \healpix directory) before running
the package}.

% And finally, the current {\tt ./configure} script allows several compilations of
% the Healpix routines to coexist by letting the user choose the name of directories
% containing the executables, libraries and include files.

\subsubsection{C configuration}

The {\tt ./configure} script will ask for the C compiler and options to
be used, and for the full path of an installed {\tt cfitsio} library to link to.
By default, only a static library is created, but the user can also ask for
 a shared (Unix/Linux systems) or dynamic (Darwin) library. \\
After compilation
(see {\tt make} section) and linking, all libraries will be 
in {\tt \$\{HEALPIX\}/lib/chealpix.*}\ .

\subsubsection{C++ configuration}

The {\tt ./configure} script will 
ask for the full path to an installed {\tt cfitsio} library to link to, and then provide a choice of
predefined targets corresponding to different combinations of C++ compilers and
options. Each of those targets is defined in a configuration file located in
{\tt Healpix\_\hpxversion/src/cxx/config/config.}{\em target}.
The user can therefore add new targets or edit existing ones, and the
{\tt ./configure} script will update its menu accordingly.
If a fairly recent version
(4.2 or higher) of gcc and g++ is installed on the system, the target
"generic\_gcc" should always work, except under MacOSX, where ``osx'' target is
required.  \\
The environment variables EXTERNAL\_CFITSIO, 
CFITSIO\_EXT\_LIB, 
CFITSIO\_EXT\_INC and 
HEALPIX\_TARGET 
will be set according to the choices made above.
\\
If the HEALPIX configuration file is sourced as described in \S~\ref{subsub:conf}, the full path to the C++
executables will be added to the environment PATH variable.


\subsubsection{Fortran 90 configuration}
When you run {\tt ./configure} on a supported system 
you will be prompted to enter compiler optimisation flags.
We have not attempted to provide the best optimisation flags for all
operating systems. The configure
script will have a guess at optimisation options for some systems, but it
is up to the user to figure out an optimal set\footnote{In particular, the Intel Fortran
Compiler, available for free for PC's with Intel-like processors, have a set of
optimization options for each of Intel processor families (Pro, II, MMX, 4). Please consult
the online help ({\tt ifort -help}) or PDF documentation ({\tt
/opt/intel\_fc\_80/doc/} or {\tt /opt/intel/fc/9.*/doc}) or HTML documentation
({\tt /opt/intel/fce/10.*/doc/Doc\_Index.htm}) for further information.}. From our experience,
we have not found significant accumulation of numerical error even
when using the most aggressive optimisation level available. \\
If the HEALPIX configuration file is sourced as described in \S~\ref{subsub:conf}, the full path to the F90
executables will be added to the environment PATH variable.

\subsubsection{IDL configuration}
You will be asked for the external applications you want to use to visualize the
Postscript and PNG files created by IDL. \\
If the HEALPix configuration file is
sourced as described in \S~\ref{subsub:conf}, the aliases {\tt hidl} and {\tt hidle}
are also defined to give you access to HEALPIX routines from IDL.


\subsection{Compilation and installation}

The \\
\mycode{make} \\
command will compile one or several of the C, C++ and F90 packages
depending on what was configured with the {\tt ./configure} script.
Specific packages can be compiled with the respective commands 
\begin{verbatim}
   make c-all
   make cpp-all
   make f90-all.
\end{verbatim}

To perform several compilation jobs simultaneously, the command {\tt make -j [jobs]}
can be used.

Please neglect any possible warnings at compile time. If you run into
trouble please refer to the section \htmlref{{\bf Troubleshooting and further
information}}{sec:troubleshoot}.

After running {\tt make}, the user must re-login to ensure that the new profiles built by the installation
procedure are correctly sourced. Only then will the
user have full access to the specific \healpix
environment variables etc.

\subsection{Testing the installation}

All installed libraries and executables can be tested with 
\begin{verbatim}
   make test
\end{verbatim}

while specific tests of the C, C++ and Fortran products can be performed with,
respectively
\begin{verbatim}
   make c-test
   make cpp-test
   make f90-test
\end{verbatim}
For the latter, Table~\ref{tab:f90_tests} lists the codes tested with the
parameter files used, as well as the data files produced and the respective
reference files.

\end{table}


{\bf{Notes:}} 
\begin{itemize}
\item the input power spectrum (in {\tt
Healpix\_\hpxversion/test/cl.fits}) used to generate the Fortran90 test maps
is currently the WMAP 1yr best fit, in $(\mu$K$)^2$, and is therefore different from the one
included in releases 1.* (that can still be found in {\tt cl\_old.fits}).
See \htmladdnormallink{{\tt  http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/}}{http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/} 
for details on WMAP and its data products.
%
\item the file  {\tt Healpix\_\hpxversion/test/wmap\_lcdm\_sz\_lens\_wmap5\_cl\_v3.fits}
 was added for convenience, even though
 it is currently *NOT* used for any of the simulated test maps.

 It has been adapted to run with \healpix  from WMAP 5yr best fit model for
$\Lambda$-CDM + SZ + lensing with B mode = 0, in $(\mu$K$)^2$ (input file: 
\htmladdnormallink{{\footnotesize{\tt  http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/map/dr3/dcp/params/c\_l/wmap\_lcdm\_sz\_lens\_wmap5\_\-cl\_v3.dat}}}{http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/map/dr3/dcp/params/c_l/wmap_lcdm_sz_lens_wmap5_cl_v3.dat}).
 For the value of the cosmological parameters, see 
 \htmladdnormallink{{\footnotesize{\tt  http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/dr3/params/lcdm\_sz\_lens\_wmap5.cfm}}}{%
http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/dr3/params/lcdm_sz_lens_wmap5.cfm}
\end{itemize}

In order to test the new \healpix profile set-up one can then attempt
to run any C++ or F90 facility from any directory on your system. Similarly,
IDL should be tested by invoking {\tt hidl} or {\tt hidlde}.



\subsection{Cleaning up}
Three levels of cleaning are available:
\begin{verbatim}
  make clean
\end{verbatim}
will remove the intermediate files created during compilation, such as object
files, (Fortran) modules files, ... found in the source or build directories;
\begin{verbatim}
  make tidy
\end{verbatim}
same as above, and will also remove the \healpix executables, libraries and module and/or
include files;
\begin{verbatim}
  make distclean
\end{verbatim}
will return the \healpix directory to its original 'distribution' state by discarding the same
files as above, as well as the executable and library directories and the top
level Makefile.

\section{Upgrading from 2.0 to 2.1}

The internal structure of release 2.1 is quite different from release 2.0 and to
avoid confusion during the compilation we highly recommend to put the new
release in a {\em different} directory, rather than putting the new package on
top of the old one. 
If you actually change the name of the 'active' \healpix directory care must be taken that
all references to the old directory are removed from your system profile before
adding the new ones (see Note on {\it Re}-installation).

% \section{Upgrading from 2.10 to 2.11}

%% See the \htmladdnormallink{\healpix Primer}{intro.htm} for a note on the change of convention for polarization.

\section{A Note on {\it Re}-installation}

As a result of the line added to your shell profile which explicitly
sources the \healpix profile, care must be taken if the package 
is reinstalled in a different directory. If such reinstallation
is desired, the included line must be removed from your system profile,
allowing the corrected version to be added.  

\section{Troubleshooting and further information}
\label{sec:troubleshoot}
This section contains a list of difficulties which we have dealt
with. It is by no means exhaustive. A troubleshooting forum has
been established at \htmladdnormallink{{\tt \healpixwebpage/healpixSoftwareProblemsBugsSolutions.shtml}}{\healpixwebpage/healpixSoftwareProblemsBugsSolutions.shtml}, where we 
list current questions and solutions to known problems (for
a given release). A bug tracker is also available on SourceForge \htmladdnormallink{at this address}{http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=130539&atid=718128}.
If the problem you encounter is not addressed in those forums nor below, 
please contact 
{\em healpix} {\tt at} {\em jpl.nasa.gov}


\subsection{Installation under Microsoft Windows}
\label{sec:windows}
The installation and usage of HEALPix require many standard Unix/Linux tools
(such as {\tt sh, make, awk, grep, sed, ls, wc, cat, more, nm, ar}) as well as C,
C++ and Fortran compilers. To install it under Windows, you will need to
\begin{itemize}
\item Install Cygwin on your machine 
(see \htmladdnormallink{{\tt http://cygwin.com/}}{http://cygwin.com/}).
In addition to the default packages, you need at least the {\tt binutils,
    coreutils, util-linux, bash, gawk, grep, make} and {\tt sed} packages, as
    well as {\tt gcc} and {gcc-g++} packages, all available at 
\htmladdnormallink{{\tt http://cygwin.com/packages/}}{http://cygwin.com/packages/}.
\item Install the latest gfortran binaries for Cygwin from 
\htmladdnormallink{{\tt http://quatramaran.ens.fr/$\tilde{}$coudert/gfortran/}}{%
http://quatramaran.ens.fr/~coudert/gfortran/}, 
following the instructions at 
\htmladdnormallink{{\tt http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries}}{%
http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries}.
\item Unpack the HEALPix software package
\item Run configure as you would on other platforms
\item The C++ code can be compiled using HEALPIX\_TARGET=generic\_gcc
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Problems with CFITSIO}
\subsubsection{Compilation of CFITSIO Fortran wrappers}
The most common problem with the Fortran \healpix compilation will produce
messages like:
\begin{verbatim}
  ld: Undefined symbols:
   _ftbnfm_
   _ftclos_
   _ftcrhd_
   _ftdkey_
   ...
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
  fitstools.f90: undefined reference to `ftdkey_'
  fitstools.f90: undefined reference to `ftbnfm_'
  fitstools.f90: undefined reference to `ftclos_'
  ...
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
 Undefined symbols:
  "_ftghbn_", referenced from:
      ___fitstools_MOD_read_fits_cut4.clone.2 in libhealpix.a(fitstools.o)
      ___fitstools_MOD_getsize_fits.clone.1 in libhealpix.a(fitstools.o)
      ___fitstools_MOD_getsize_fits in libhealpix.a(fitstools.o)
   ...
 ld: symbol(s) not found
 collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
\end{verbatim}
and occurs when the CFITSIO installation script could not find a valid fortran compiler.\\
To solve this problem
\begin{enumerate}
\item Go into the CFITSIO directory. \\
Assuming that {\bf ifort} is available on your
system (it can be replaced below by {\tt \bf gfortran}, {\tt \bf g95}, {\tt \bf f77}, {\tt \bf f2c}, $\ldots$) type: \\
\mycode{./configure FC={\bf ifort}} \\
\mycode{make} \\
\mycode{make install} \hskip 0.3cm (optional).
%
\item Then go back into the \healpix directory and do \\
\mycode{./configure} \hskip 0.3cm (making sure that you are using the newly created {\tt libcfitsio.a} library) \\
\mycode{make} \\
\mycode{make test}
\end{enumerate}
See also the note below on 64 bit architectures.

\subsubsection{CFITSIO problems on systems with 64 bit architecture}

\begin{enumerate}
%
\item {\bf Linux, Mac OS X}

If the \healpix codes are compiled in 64 bits, and the GNU C Compiler ({\tt
gcc}) is used to compiled CFITSIO, then issue the following commands in the
CFITSIO directory:

\begin{verbatim}
  ./configure FC='gcc -m64'
  make
\end{verbatim}

You can
then force compilation to the same binary format by entering
{\tt -m64} when asked for the optimisation options in the
\healpix configure script.

\item {\bf IRIX64}

On a 64-bit architecture such as IRIX64, CFITSIO will have to be
compiled in the same  binary format as the \healpix codes.
This can be achieved by typing the
following on the
command line in the CFITSIO directory:
 
\begin{verbatim}
  rm config.cache    
  setenv CC 'cc -n32'
  ./configure
  make
\end{verbatim}

Alternatively you can replace the {\tt -n32} with {\tt -64}. You can
then force compilation to the same binary format by entering either
{\tt -n32} or {\tt -64} when asked for the optimisation options in the
\healpix configure script.
%
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{CFITSIO linking problems}

A particular problem encountered with the CFITSIO Version 2.0 release relates
to the inclusion of various libraries within the system release for a given
machine. This led to some modifications to the Makefile to include the specific
library links {\tt -lm -lnsl -lsocket} on SunOS, but only {\tt -lm} for IRIX64.
If your OS is not completely supported by the distribution, you may find this
as one source of errors. The CFITSIO developers recommend compilation of the
{\tt testprog} routine. Inspection of the libraries linked after executing the
{\tt make testprog} statement will reveal those you need to include in the
Makefile.

\subsubsection{CFTISIO and Debian/Linux}

Some problems have been reported on Debian/Linux systems during the
linking to the CFITSIO library shipped with Linux. If these problems
occur, try to recompile the CFITSIO library from scratch before linking
to \healpix.



% \subsection{fft.f compilation}

% While  Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) applications are the bread and butter of our
% methods, the actual codes we use to compute FFTs are in some sense external
% to the package. We have chosen the FFTPACK routines rrfti, rfftb and
% rfftf because they are publicly available software, and we have found
% them to be both reliable and fast. 

% However, unfortunately they are not implemented
% in Fortran90, but something more akin to FORTRAN66.
% If your compiler chokes on fft.f (in the directory {\tt src/f90/mod})
% there is almost certainly a compiler flag which overrides your
% compilers anxiety about deprecated programming style. For supported
% operating systems we have tried to let the configure script guess what
% these flags are but they might differ from compiler to compiler so
% please refer to your compiler documentation.

\subsection{{\tt diff} shows that the test files are different from
the supplied files}

This by itself is no cause for concern. When comparing using a
{\tt diff } on the test files will most likely report a
difference even when the installation has been successful. 
This  may be due to the fact that
different installations  have different floating point
representations. Also, the FITS files carry date information.

\subsection{MIPSPro Compilers on SGI machines}

Regrettably, the MIPSpro Compiler Version 7.20 has a compiler bug
which cause run-time memory faults. We have not found any problems
with Version 7.2.1.1m.

\subsection{Try {\tt unlimit}}

If you have unforeseen problems at runtime, try {\tt unlimit} (under csh or tcsh) or {\tt ulimit} (under sh or bash), in order to increase the heap and stack memory size. It
sometimes helps.

\subsection{{\tt hidl} usage}

We have found that in very rare cases the alias {\tt hidl}
is not recognised by the user's system. Usually, this is related
to the local system's IDL script. A quick-fix is achieved
by setting the environment variable {\tt IDL\_STARTUP} to be
equal to the \healpix startup file {\tt HEALPix\_startup}
{\bf including} the directory path to the file. This enables
the user to access the \healpix IDL procedures simply by invoking
IDL. For example, in the typical installation documented
above for a user running the tcsh shell, the command \hfill \\
%\begin{verbatim}
{\tt setenv IDL\_STARTUP
/disk1/user1/HEALPix\_\hpxversion/src/idl/HEALPix\_startup}
\hfill \\
%\end{verbatim}
should be issued (or added to the user's shell profile).

If the user already has an IDL startup file, then
this should be merged with {\tt HEALPix\_startup}. This temporary
solution does mean that the \healpix IDL procedures are available
in the {\tt IDL\_PATH} at all times, which may lead to conflicts with
user-defined procedures. The {\tt hidl} invocation was intended 
to circumvent these issues, allowing \healpix IDL procedures to
be available only when desired.

A proper fix requires the user to ask the local system
administrator to adjust the local IDL script.

\subsection{Mac OS X,  X11 and IDL cursor}
If the IDL cursor does not work correctly on X11 windows under Mac OS X, and the
2nd and 3rd button clicks are ineffective, type
\begin{itemize}
\item under Tiger (10.4.*): \\
{ {\tt defaults write com.apple.x11 wm\_click\_through -bool true}}
\item under Leopard (10.5.*) and Snow Leopard (10.6.*): \\
{ {\tt defaults write org.x.x11 wm\_click\_through -bool true}}
\end{itemize}
at your X11 prompt and restart X11.
(See also {\tt mollcusor} documentation in \linklatexhtml{''IDL
Facilities''}{idl.pdf}{idl.htm}).

\subsection{Using GDL instead of IDL}
\label{sec:using_gdl}

GNU Data Language (GDL), is a {\em free} clone of IDL 6.0 (for more information see
\htmladdnormallink{{\tt http://gnudatalanguage.sourceforge.net}}{http://gnudatalanguage.sourceforge.net}).
Both the source code and precompiled executables for various platforms are available.

When used to run IDL-Healpix routines, GDL \gdlversion or more gives
satisfactory results\footnote{All the caveats listed below have been noticed in GDL v0.9rc3
and may be solved in subsequent versions. Please send all your questions
{\em on} GDL directly to GDL developpers.}. The calculations agree with those done under IDL, with
comparable computation times, but a few features are missing in the production
of Postscript, GIF and PNG files, as described below.



\subsubsection{Specific requirements}

\healpix requires a few IDL routines that are not yet part of GDL.
Among those are \begin{itemize}
\item {\tt congrid.pro},
\item {\tt dl\_dos.pro}$^\dagger$,
\item {\tt dl\_unix.pro}$^\dagger$,
\item {\tt doc\_library.pro}$^\dagger$,
\item {\tt file\_which.pro},
\item {\tt interpol.pro}.
		\end{itemize}
Most of these routines can be downloaded from
\htmladdnormallink{{\tt http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/idl\-lib\-srch.html}}
{http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/idllibsrch.html}.
However, those marked with a $^\dagger$ above can only be found in IDL packages
({\tt \$IDL\_DIR/lib/*.pro}). They are required for online documentation of the
\healpix routines (ie {\tt /HELP} keyword available on most routines).



% These routines, coded in IDL are part of the ITTVIS library and
% , are part of the IDL package ({\tt \$IDL_DIR/lib/*.pro}) and can also be 
% can be found at
% \htmladdnormallink{{\tt http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/idllibsrch.html}}
% {http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/idllibsrch.html}.
% They will run properly under GDL.

Please note that GDL must be linked with {\tt ImageMagick} during installation to produce PNG
output files.

\subsubsection{Impact of GDL limitations on \healpix}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt Ximview} won't work under GDL \gdlversion
\item Because of problems with GDL's {\tt point\_lun} routine, the reading of
FITS files with most of Astronomy User's Library routines won't be possible.
\item Currently, the 
{\tt cartview},
{\tt gnomview},
{\tt mollview} and  
{\tt orthview} 
routines won't produce Postscript nor GIF outputs when run under GDL (but PNG
files are OK, see above).
\item In those same routines, the {\tt TRANSPARENT} keyword will be ignored in the
production of PNG files under GDL. For the same reasons, {\tt hpx2gs} won't mark missing pixels as
transparent in the output PNG file.
\item The {\tt healpix\_doc} routine won't work under GDL.
%\item The behaviour of {\tt Ximview} under GDL has not been investigated.
\end{itemize}

 \subsection{Changes and New Features in Version 1.20}
 %% details of some bug fixes, configure stuff, make etc etc
 \begin{itemize}
   \item An extensive HTML documentation is included in the package (in {\tt
   [HEALPix]/doc/html/main.htm}). It is also available at the web page
   \htmladdnormallink{{\tt
   \healpixwebpage}}{\healpixwebpage},
 as well as the PostScript documention.
   \item The convention used for the normalisation of the polarization power
   spectra has been changed to match that of CMBFAST. This subject and its
   implications are described in details in the \linklatexhtml{\healpix
   Primer}{intro.pdf}{intro.htm}
   \item The pixel window functions are now provided for both temperature and
     polarization. Recalculation of the temperature window for $N_{side} > 128$
     induce a slight change of these functions (see the \linklatexhtml{``\healpix
   Primer''}{intro.pdf}{intro.htm} for details).
   \item Because of its obsolete F66 features that limited its portability with
     current f90/f95 compilers, the FFTPACK module used in
     version 1.10 is no longer in use. \healpix 1.2 can either use a different
     self contained FFT module shipped with the package, or
     use the freely available {\bf FFTW} library (see section~\ref{sec:requirements}). The script file asks which FFT the user wants
     to use. If selected, FFTW must be correctly installed (in double
     precision) before installing Healpix.
   \item It is now possible to use an OpenMP parallelisation of the Spherical
   Harmonics Transforms (see \S~\ref{sec:requirements}).
   \item The compilers now supported under \textbf{Linux} systems are
     \begin{itemize}
 	\item Intel Fortran Compiler, available for {\bf free} \\
 	\htmladdnormallink{{\tt http://www.intel.com/software/products/compilers/downloads/forlin.htm}}{http://www.intel.com/software/products/compilers/downloads/forlin.htm}
 	(tested for version  6.01 and 7.0)
 	\item Lahey/Fujitsu Compiler, both {\bf free} trial and
     commercial versions \hfill \\ \htmladdnormallink{{\tt http://www.lahey.com/linux.htm}}{http://www.lahey.com/linux.htm}
 	\item NAGWare f95, commercial \htmladdnormallink{{\tt http://www.nag.co.uk/nagware/NP.asp}}{http://www.nag.co.uk/nagware/NP.asp}
 	\item Portland Group Compiler, commercial \htmladdnormallink{{\tt http://www.pgroup.com/}}{http://www.pgroup.com/}
 	\item Fujitsu Compiler, commercial
     \end{itemize}	
   \item The \textbf{Mac} Operating System \textbf{Darwin} is now supported. To
     this date (Jan 2003) it has only been tested with NAGWare f95 \htmladdnormallink{{\tt http://www.nag.co.uk/nagware/NP.asp}}{http://www.nag.co.uk/nagware/NP.asp}.
 %   \item new Fortran subroutines and functions include: \hfill\newline
 %     {\tt ....}
   \item A small subset of routines for the pixel to sky coordinate conversion
     is now available in C (see the documentation \linklatexhtml{''C Subroutines Overview''}{csub.pdf}{csub.htm}).
   \item New Fortran subroutines have been added or upgraded (see the documentation
   \linklatexhtml{''Fortran90 Subroutines Overview''}{subroutines.pdf}{subroutines.htm}) and
   most of the Fortran facilities have been upgraded (see the documentation
   \linklatexhtml{''Fortran90 Facilities User Guidelines''}{facilities.pdf}{facilities.htm})
   \item several Fortran routines have been renamed and merged.
 	\begin{itemize}
 	\item The module {\tt wrap\_fits} has been renamed {\tt head\_fits} to reflect its
     extended capabilities,
 %  	\item The module {\tt ran_tools} has been renamed {\tt
 %      ran_tools_dist}, and the random generator code it contains has been changed,
        \item some routines no longer in use have been moved to {\tt obsolete} module
 	\end{itemize}
   \item New IDL routines have been added, and several routines have been renamed
   or merged. See the documentation \linklatexhtml{''IDL Facilities
   Overview''}{idl.pdf}{idl.htm}
   \item The configure script automatically creates a (system specific)
     profile defining useful environment variables and aliases. {\em In
     particular, the system variable {\tt HEALPIX} must be correctly
     defined (as the full path to the \healpix directory) prior to running the pipeline.}
   \item All legacy f77 or f66 codes have been removed or replaced in
     order to improve the portability
   \item The script file has been improved to, among other things, get rid of problems
     appearing under SunOS
 \end{itemize}

 \subsection{Changes and New Features in Version 1.10}

 %% details of some bug fixes, configure stuff, make etc etc
 \begin{itemize}
   \item Only native {\tt make} is required for building the
     facilities, although we do still recommend GNU make.
   \item The configure script automatically creates a (system specific)
     profile defining useful environment variables and aliases
   \item An IDL startup file is provided to ease use of IDL tools.
     Users should invoke IDL using the command {\tt hidl} to take
     advantage of these features
   \item Various bug fixes and code modifications have been completed
     to improve compatibility and usability of software with NAG F90
     and F95 compilers, and the COMPAQ (DEC) Alpha compiler
   \item New Fortran subroutines and functions include: \hfill\newline
     {\tt ang2vec, vec2ang, npix2nside, nside2npix}
   \item New IDL routines include: \hfill\newline 
      {\tt add\_nside\_fits.pro, add\_units\_fits.pro, gaussbeam.pro, getdisc\_ring.pro,
      healpixwindow.pro, npix2nside.pro, nside2npix.pro, remove\_dipole.pro, 
      today\_fits.pro, ud\_grade.pro}
   \item Those routines from The IDL Astronomy User's Library and the 
      COBE (IDL) Analysis Software library required for use by
      the \healpix IDL facilities are bundled with the distribution
