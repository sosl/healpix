HISTORY

 (version 1.00)

   ./healfast/ : 
	implementation of the polarisation
	input and output power spectrum are now in FITS ascii table, as the one generated by 
		Xcmbfast
	iterative determination of the alm (better accuracy)
		+ weighting of the rings to improve the quadrature of the alm
	weights are generatd by quad_ring and are contained in weight_n*fits
	addition of ud_grade
	use of f90 explicit interfaces

   ./visu/ :
	minor modifications on read_fits_map.pro (to read files containing several maps)
	and mollview.pro

   ./hostspot/ :
	minor modifications on the output

   ./toolkit/ :
	addition of the getdisc_ring routine

   ./healgif/ : 
        added new f90/c tools for plotting map to GIF image format



 (version 0.90)
  28/01/1998 :
   ./healfast/ : 
     Fortran 90 version (dynamical memory allocation)
     modification of write_fitsfile (in output_fits90.f)
	to write vector column of length 1024 ('1024E')
     modification of read_fitsfile (in input_fits90.f)
	to read vector column of any length
   ./visu/ : modification of read_fits_map.pro and write_fits_map.pro
	in the same way
   ./hostspot/ : addition 


 (version 0.81)
 14 Jan/1998 :
   ./healfast/ :
    -initialisation of some variables in FFT_gpd.d
 12 Dec/1997 :
   ./visu/ :
    -faster implementation of read_fits_map
    -addition of many options to mollview
 14 Nov/1997 :
   ./visu/ :
    -added the routine write_fits_map to write bintable in FITS files
    (althought it needs some improvements for header management)
    -check of the number of colors available in mollview
 07 Nov/1997 : 
   ./visu/ : 
    -corrections of some bugs in postscript output of mollview
    -read_fits_map can also read FITS images (if no extension is found)
   ./healfast/synfast.f
    -implementation of pixel convolution (top-hat)


 Oct/1997 : first release (version 0.8)
